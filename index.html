        <h2>Diary Entry 1: February 14, 2008

            Dear Diary,
            
            Today is Valentine's Day and I can't stop thinking about Edward Cullen. He is so dreamy and perfect. I wrote a poem about him:
            
            Edward, oh Edward, with skin so pale,
            Your love for me will never fail.
            Your eyes so golden, like the sun,
            I wish our love had just begun.
            
            I wish Edward was my Valentine. Maybe one day he will notice me.
            
            Love,
            mrs edward cullen</h2>

        <h2>Diary Entry 2: March 10, 2008

            Dear Diary,
            
            I saw the movie Twilight again today. Edward is so romantic and handsome. I wish I could meet someone like him in real life. I wrote another poem:
            
            Edward, my love, so strong and true,
            I wish I could be with you.
            Your vampire charm, your dazzling smile,
            Makes my heart race a mile.
            
            I can't wait for the next movie to come out. I hope Edward and I stay together forever.
            
            Love,
            mrs edward cullen</h2>

            Dear Diary,
            
            I found out that Robert Pattinson, the actor who plays Edward, is going to be in a new movie. I'm so excited! I wrote a poem to celebrate:
            
            Robert, oh Robert, with hair so wild,
            Your talent as an actor is truly styled.
            As Edward Cullen, you stole my heart,
            In every scene, you played your part.
            
            I can't wait to see Robert in his new movie. I know he will be amazing.
            
            Love,
            mrsedwardcullen</h2>

        <h3>Diary Entry 4: May 30, 2008

            Dear Diary,
            
            I just finished reading Twilight for the third time. I love the part where Edward saves Bella from the car accident. He is so brave and heroic. I wrote a poem about it:
            
            Edward, my hero, so strong and true,
            I wish I could be saved by you.
            Your love for Bella, so deep and pure,
            In my heart, it will always endure.
            
            I wish I could live in the world of Twilight forever. Edward is the perfect boyfriend.
            
            Love,
            MRSEDWARDCULLEN</h3>

        <h3>Diary Entry 5: June 25, 2008

            Dear Diary,
            
            Today is my birthday and all I want is for Edward Cullen to be real. I know it's stupid, but I can't help dreaming about him. I wrote one last poem:
            
            Edward, my love, in books you dwell,
            In my heart, you cast a spell.
            I wish I could be by your side,
            In Forks, where our love could abide.
            
            I hope one day I can find you and we can be vampires together forever!!!!!!.
            
            Love,
            MRSEDWARDCULLEN</h3>
